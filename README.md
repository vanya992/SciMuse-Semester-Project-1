## Getting Started

### Installing

First thing you would like to do is to make a GitHub repo, with necessary files to get you started. 

Connect your GitHub profile to the GitHub Desktop app, so that all changes you make can be saved properly. 

After you have done that, clone the GitHub repo with simple click on the right side of the repo section, click on Code, and then Clone repo, with finding spot on your computer for it.

GitHub Desktop is conected to your text editor of choice, mine is VCSode, and I can recommend it. As soon as you can open it with GitHub Desktop, you are good to go since it is just one click to get to coding, and there it takes you Open with VSCode (in my case, you can have editor of your choosing.)


### Running

If you would like to be able to check all the changes you are making right away, you can do so by instaling Live Server extention in VSCode, and on right click you can find option Open with Live Server, as soon as you click on that, your project will be opened in your browser. It is still in the local storage so you cannot share it with anyone, but that is also possible with deploying your site on some deploying platform such as fex Netlify.
